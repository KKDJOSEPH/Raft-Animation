## Clone + Run
```terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:KKDJOSEPH/Game_Review.git
$ npm start
```

## Prerequirements
- [React-hook](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-react-dev)
- [anime.js](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/)

## Notice
- This is a working draft.
- Better quickly run through each page before using it. Let the animations know where they should be.
- If you quickly press the "next" button :fast_forward: multiple times, the text may blur each other. You need to wait until the animations finish and continue.
- Page 29 contains so many animations that there may be some problems when you first reach this page.
- If you meet any problems, wait until the animation is done, go to another page then go back. If this doesn't solve your problem, rerun the project.
